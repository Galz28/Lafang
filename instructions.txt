Disclaimer: If result is not found, the server will get an error or in the web page theres no result just an empty form. I apoligize for that for I was not able to fix and handle that kind of error.I am not yet an expert regarding with the frontend and backend. My objective is to render the data in a presentable way and understand how the backend code works. Regarding the backend I get it in the github for my reference on how to fetch the data and use the api for the reason that i am new to this kind of development.
